# Writing a reproducable paper with R Markdown and Pagedown
 This repository contains files and a template to write a reproducible paper in pagedown. `paper.pdf` contains the pdf-formatted version of our template which provides an introduction to the fairly new pagedown R-package as well as "tricks" and code to produce important elements of scientific papers (e.g., tables, figures, inlince code, etc.).
 
The file underlying this template is `paper.Rmd` which contains all the code and input to produce a good-looking working-paper "style" doucment (in html and in pdf).
